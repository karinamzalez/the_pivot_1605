### Description

The Pivot is a Module 3 assignment from the Turing School of Software and Design. The premise is that a team is given a code base from the final Module 2 project "Little Shop of Orders" and is required to "pivot" with the code base. Our new project involved building a marketplace of produce suppliers and items. The key requirements of the pivot are that no functionality can be lost from the original website, and layers of multitenancy are added.
