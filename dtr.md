  Development branch, master is EXCLUSIVELY used for production ready things. Small pull requests into branch. Local dev branch per person.
  Really good commit messages. Reviewing code before merging and commenting, don't merge your own pull request. Slack when you've made a pull request. Double check that all tests are passing before you open a pull request. Write it in your pull request that all tests are passing. (or needs code review because they are not.). Keep commits and branches small.

  * Kris: enjoys pairing, open to suggestions.
  * Zach: enjoys working together in same space, call him out on things.
  * Chris: enjoys active feedback when driving, prefers pairs of two. Needs a break every two hours or so.
